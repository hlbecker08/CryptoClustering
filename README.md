# CryptoClustering

This analysis explores price percentage changes over time for various digital currencies.

We begin by scaling and segmenting the data into clusters using K-means clustering. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we will apply the elbow method. The results will then be visualized in a scatter plot using hvplot.

Next, we will create a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model and perform the same K-means clustering and visualization process as above.

Finally, we will compare the results of the two clustering methods to assess which one is more effective for the given data.

This analysis was conducted in collaboration with Conner Dekok.
